*** Little Racket library that implements Difference List
It is a lazy immutable data structure that supports O(1) concatenation
and reverse operations.

Implementation is highly inspired by [[https://github.com/batsh-dev-team/Dlist][this Ocaml library]].

As a usage example see [[https://github.com/slamko/dlist.rkt/blob/master/example.rkt][example.rkt]].
